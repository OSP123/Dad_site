					<div class="testimonial_text"><q>I highly recommend Salim to anyone looking for a highly effective and reliable real estate agent. He promptly walked us through the whole process and answered all our concerns. The best was, even when the deal was closed, he continued to explain all details to us. Thank you !!! We appreciate your work.</q>

					<div class="testimonial_text"><q>Being a first time home buyer we had no clue about whole home buying process. Salim was always ready to help and answer our questions & explain things in detail. We never felt that our selling agent was in rush or mislead us to make his commission. Very responsive and professional in returning emails or returning calls. Salim understood our needs very well & helped us short list properties we wanted to see & put competitive and reasonable offers. He was really great in co-ordinating with all concerned parties like lender, inspectors, listing agent, escrow. All contingencies were cleared within 2 weeks and we signed loan docs 21 days before escrow close date. Overall great experience of home buying in these tough times for buyer.</q>
